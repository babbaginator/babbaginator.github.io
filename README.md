### Projects 
> [De-Canon](https://www.de-canon.com) is a literary social practice art project that centers the works and voices of writers of color. Founded in 2017 as a “pop-up library” + social engagement project, with a mission to challenge and unsettle notions of the (western) literary canon while also questioning precepts of canonization itself, De-Canon encourages new paradigms of writing and reading. 

> [Have Book, Will Travel](http://www.havebookwilltravel.com) is a searchable database of authors willing to travel, reading series currently seeking guest writers, and venues available for booking events.
